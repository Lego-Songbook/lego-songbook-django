I'm experimenting to use django as the backend to
Lego Songbook.
It may or may not work.

Using django comes with lots of benefits:
it is relatively easy to use and to manage the songs, as it has a database manager built-in.
It also has a built-in admin site, which is also very intuitive and easy-to-use.
All these features will make the song & setlist management more fluent,
and will welcome other people to contribute to the site.

Here is a tentative plan for this project:

1. Create the models.
1. Copy the "views" from the [current Lege Songbook repo](https://github.com/kipyin/lego-songbook/tree/master/_layouts).
1. Incorporate django with the views.
1. Find a way to deploy the site.
1. Populate the django database with the current songs and setlists.
1. CI & CD.
1. Give the team admin access.
